# dynamiqs_adaptative
A version of dynamiqs implementing a solver adaptative in the size of the modes.

## truncation estimator 

This version of dynamiqs implements an estimator of the error made by the truncation from an infinite Fock space to a finite one.

## adaptative solver

This version will also adapt the size in modes on which to compute the simulation to save time by disregarding less populated modes.
